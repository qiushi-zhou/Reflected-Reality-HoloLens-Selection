# Reflected Reality HoloLens2

This is the code for the software study apparatus.
The study scene is under App/Scenes
Once deployed and run on a HoloLens 2, the tracking of the mirror space will be calibrated by reading a QR code displayed on the PC screen behind the mirror.
Then, different conditions of the study can be loaded through MRTK hand menu to render targets in and out of the mirror, along with the corresponding finger pointer and hand ray.

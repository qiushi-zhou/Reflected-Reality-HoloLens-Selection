# Reflected Reality HoloLens2

This is the code for the software study apparatus.\\
The study scene is under App/Scenes\\
Once deployed and run on a HoloLens 2, the tracking of the mirror space will be calibrated by reading a QR code displayed on the PC screen behind the mirror.\\
The RealObject and ReflectedObject will mimic the reflection of each other across the mirror (QR code plane) when interacted with.\\
The FittsRing objects can be used to perform target selection tasks.
